<p itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;Greece or Italy sell me an island, I&#8217;ll call its independence and host the migrants and provide jobs for them building their new country,&#8221; he wrote.</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">More than 2,300 people have died at sea trying to reach Europe since January, many of them Syrians who fled their country&#8217;s four-and-a-half year conflict.</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">Sawiris said in a television interview that he would approach the governments of Greece and Italy about his plan.</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">Asked by AFP whether he believed it could work, he said: &#8220;Of course it&#8217;s feasible.&#8221;</p>

<p itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;You have dozens of islands which are deserted and could accommodate hundreds of thousands of refugees.&#8221;</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">Sawiris said an island off Greece or Italy could cost between $10 million and $100 million, but added the &#8220;main thing is investment in infrastructure.&#8221;</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">There would be &#8220;temporary shelters to house the people, then you start employing the people to build housing, schools, universities, hospitals.</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;And if things improve, whoever wants to go back (to their homeland) goes back,&#8221; said Sawiris, whose family developed the popular El Gouna resort on Egypt&#8217;s Red Sea coast.</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">He conceded such a plan could face challenges, including the likely difficulty of persuading Greece or Italy to sell an island, and figuring out jurisdiction and customs regulations.</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">But those who took shelter would be treated as &#8220;human beings,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The way they are being treated now, they are being treated like cattle.&#8221;</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">Sawiris is the chief executive of Orascom TMT, which operates mobile telephone networks in a number of Middle Eastern and African countries plus Korea as well as underwater communications networks.</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">He also owns an Egyptian television channel.</p>
