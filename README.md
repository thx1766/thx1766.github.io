This is a game developed iteratively

the first level / version of the game / step

get some red dots floating around with a stick figure dude

the dude is moved around by a joystick and an attack button

the joystick is optomized for toichscreen devices but injitially it seemed to work but would scroll the screen so i had to add some logic to control that behavior and stop the screen from scrolling from touch events other than moving the joystick and attacking

we're hosted as a single html file on github thru github pages currently
would be nice as a todo item to split the html up logically
also split out the javascript sensibly
eventually use lightning JS and solid JS together to draw to smart television devices with limted input like handheld remote controls
possibly apple tv version

right now it works with WASD and arrow keys and spacebar for attack in addition to the touch interface

primary test device is an ipad with a macik keyboard

next commit is replacing red dots with sticj figure bad guys
