inspirded by GTA but also state of emergency video games but also want to ad delements of cyberpunk, for example good guy stick figure changes to a more complicated customizable stick figure, and add elements inspured by the game cyberpunk 2077, where ive played the first hour several times
as a kid o loved playing red faction, with a keyboard and mouse, so impementing gameplay like that at some point woulbe ne awesome like geo mod tech to blow up walls of rock to walk through, could implement in 2d version of game top down with walls with a weapon type of explosive minig charge, with a "level of the game" going from bad guy enemies eleimnate 5 of 10 to get to the green zone and then at th egreen zone level 2 you are in a large swuare and need to pick up the mining charges, after moving over to pick up the charges are enalbled and disappear from the map and are instead carried by the good guy miner dude and attack button becomes drop charge button while carrying and then allows you to drop at a location with the charge on the map agein but also a red radius for the blast zone that will destroy walls if the blast sone overlaps the wall when dropped and activated, and is activated when the good guy moved out of the blast radius and turns blast radius a different color and then the attack button doesnt work when youre in the blast radius but does when youre out of it and when you tap it it anumates and destroys the wall and then the good guy dude miner can walk through the rock wall where the blast radius destoried it
if the blast radius does not include walls the minig charge appears again on the map inside the square somewhere that the good gy minder dude must walk over to and pick up again and try again to blow up the wall
there coud be a level three where once you excape from the square walls with the minig charge everything animates to become 3d with stick figures still but wireframes of walls inside a larger pentagon shaped room
other level 2 options for the green zone from the first level could be customize your character based on the enemies destroyed in the first level, tracking what type of weapon they had and what type of other loot they may have been carrying like credits for a vending machine thatlets you add items to your library that you can add to your stick figure
