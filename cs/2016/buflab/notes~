$ebp address to point to:
0xbfffb3e8

set address to beginning of space: $ebp+12: 0xbfffb3f4

$esp-4 gets set to 0x08048db0, address b08d0408, where smoke begins

everything is relative to $esp
want to set 0xbfffb3ec as starting code address for beginning of buffer

step twice and see where we've landed in the code
0xbfffb3ec -> reverse to ec b3 ff bf
