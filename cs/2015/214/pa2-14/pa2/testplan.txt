Test plan for code, including input and expected output.

Main.c demonstrates use of various functions

Function main() calls function test()

Function test tests SLCreate and SLInsert, and demonstrates use of SLPrint

Comments in function main demonstrate use, but are commented out for this late resubmission, as I haven't finished rearranging, but don't know the limit for resubmissions
