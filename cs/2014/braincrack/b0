simulated eye contact with 'quantum-interactive' live performance

eye contact from various sectors of room

central point for a single iris target (opaque but changes perimeter) - composed of sphincter arrangement

low quality - solid circle changes dilation (draw with move1rotate1 repeat 360)
	pattern: move1rotate1 repeat 359 move2rotate1
		move2rotate1
		move1rotate2
