moores law

build software in c continiously

schedule programming assignments

start portfolio with cs214, backtrace with algo, reconstruct syntax, etc

libraries based on my own language use for an individual function

functions are context sensitive

build libraries that dynamically link to live speech generated on input
	(macros to expand and link - like autocorrect, but for trading stocks - jk hacking the stock market is lame - expand and link tags of word, tags of images of google searches for words - hack wikipedia, google, translate.google.com, etc)
	but realistically use for dealing with overloading of words in math
		conversations in linear algebra

index of tshirts - display self information

clothing that dynamically shifts (advertizing prohibited - images can be hacked individually, but most must be approved through proper channels - cafepress for google image searches)

displays integrated as eink at first with nanotech

display with pixels dense in a region as terminating fibers

terminating flush to create pixel

2x2
rgby

fibers woven into a fabric and into diffuse microleds and lcd gateways

led cluster and lcd cluster 

brightness from led of a specific color - voltage flowing through

moores law - 3dimensional information

higher dimensions for more information - physical stress, etc

allow overloading of functions with a clarification/disambig for on-the-fly "autocorrect - for example, word that is overloaded has a visible overloaded portion, and a hidden cloud of possible meanings, and an activated link to a library file with a longer hyperlink to a database of information

database is balanced based on compilation and access needs

distributed process - log into each physical machine locally, and start processes on physical or virtual processor space - each processor can run its own bot that gathers jobs from a central queuing system

quantum is overloading of all possible states for someting to be linked with
balancing with single active point to point (object a (tags 034568) object b(tags 123) :: a-0|b-1, a-0|b-2, ... a-8|b-3) etc

operating system is distribution of AI applications - access to: storage space (vHDD and vRAM), network, or some sub-partition of addresses or namespaces (attempt communication over available ports) - communication as in HTTP traffic - udp and tcp packet streams of accessing a website, etc)

start looking into displays of all network data live - tcpdump, but in HD

udpdump
tcpdump

HDump
