plan for machinelist:

start a server that waits for a connection from a controlling node

control code to search and boot into other machines (based on universal list of machines)

sleeper_app: waits for a connection on a port
after a connection is established, commands can be sent to the remote machine
	fork processes
	start threads
	etc...

send it information to build executables, run makefiles, etc

(sleeper - gets connection - switches into a processing mode)

first stage would just be an application that waits for a connection
then a control system

something like a configuration management system and a single application with the resources of many machines

possible uses:
	mining wikipedia
	mass translation of pages into multiple languages
	think of the machines as running concurrent threads
	base execution on how many other users are logged into the machine
