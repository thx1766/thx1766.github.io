<h2>
CS 198:431 Software Engineering Project</h2></center>


<font size="+2">The course project </font>in this class are run along
the lines originally laid out by Elaine Kant at CMU in the early 80's.
(See ACM Software Engieering Notes, 1981). Basically, these involve teams
of 4-5 people, but I tend to require everyone to work on the same general problem
in order to both make grading fairer, and to allow me to take parts of
lectures to discuss problems I encountered with the project documents as
they are being submitted, which should then be of interest to 
everyone.<font size="+1"></font>
<p><font size="+1">
The document that describes the general aspects of the project is 
available as a
<a href="http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/%7Eborgida/SE431/Fa11-proj-manual.pdf">16 page pdf file here</a>, or as an 
<a href="http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/%7Eborgida/SE431/Fa10-proj-manual.2up.pdf">8 page (2 pages to 1) reduction 
here.</a>
Please read it immediately!</font>


</p><p><font size="+2">Working in teams</font> 
</p><p>
The following list is a very short summary of suggestions, and is reproduced 
 from 
<a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/%7Esme/CSC302/teamwork.html">
Professor Steve Easterbrook's notes on Software Engineering projects: </a>
</p><ul>
<li>The first thing to do is to find some times when you can all meet as a 
team 
  (we ask you to decide on the times for these on the team information 
sheet). 
</li><li>  If you decide to drop the course, please notify your partners and 
the tutor/professor 
  as early as possible.

  </li><li> Arrange for at least one full team meeting per week, outside the 
timetabled 
    sessions, and ensure that all members are available at the designated 
time. 
    Be sensitive to each other's constraints in scheduling these - 
especially 
    as some students cannot be on campus every day of the week.</li>
  <li>Produce a written agenda for each meeting, and designate a 
chairperson and 
    a secretary. The secretary should take minutes, and type them up for 
circulation 
    by the next meeting. Rotate these roles during the term.</li>
  <li> Do not take important decisions at meetings if the whole team is 
not present. 
    By all means discuss the issues, but save the decision until you are 
all there.</li>
  <li> Try not to resort to voting too often. If you find you have to vote 
on 
    every decision, then its time to rethink how you arrive at consensus. 
In particular, 
    if the same person or persons lose every vote, then your team is in 
danger 
    of fragmenting. Bear in mind that to be a productive team, you need to 
learn 
    to listen to one another.</li>
  <li> Try not to get personally attached to ideas. Use techniques such as 
brainstorming, 
    in which the team generates as many ideas a possible without any 
reflection 
    on whether the ideas coming out are sensible or not. At the end of the 
exercise, 
    all ideas are owned by the team as a whole: there should be no attempt 
to 
    remember who said what.</li>
 
 <li>
 You may want to assign overall responsibility for the various tasks 
 involved in each assignment to a particular team member.  Alternatively, 
 you may want to assign specific roles to team members, such as:
<ul>
    <li> Overall responsibility for putting together the write-up for each assignment;
    </li><li> Overall responsibility for asigning tasks and checking everyone's progress;
    </li><li> Overall responsibility for managing risk;
    </li><li> Overall responsibility for each change request (assignments 2 and 4);
    </li><li> Chief reviewer for code checked back in to the repository
     </li><li> etc.
</li></ul></li></ul>

These are <i>general</i> and much more extensive notes on
working in groups on software engineering projects at university</a>. In 
my opinion they are  <i>outstanding</i> -- the result of many years of
experience by the author as TA and instructor for project courses. 
The material is presented with the kind permission of
Professor Stephanie Ludi. I strongly recommend reading Chapters
2,3,5,6,7 and Part III, right at the beginning of the course. 

</p><p>

</p><p>
Note that in this course, I normally refrain from taking
action if there are problems within a team, because problem resolution
is a key skill that I hope you all learn. The peer evaluation form
that you will fill out for everyone on your team  is  one place where 
you will be able to inform me
of difficulties/problems, and is  one "stick" that you can use
(sparingly) to deal with difficulties.

</p><p><font size="+2">Project deliverables</font> <font color="green">(and
what we look for while grading)</font>:
<br>The following is a list of deliverables, described in the handout which
you have received, together with due dates. It is your responsibility to
read the above handout and to prepare these documents on time. Except for 
code, which can be ASCii, 
<b><i>all deliverables must be PDF files</i></b> and should be submitted 
via Sakai by 11:55pm of the dates indicated below.
</p><blockquote><i>Please make sure that every submission identifies the team,
the team-members contributing, the editor, and date; and it must have an
<b>Acknowledgements</b>
section indicating who contributed what part, (<font size="-1"> This is 
useful
for knowing to whom to direct questions, </font>) as well as outside 
resources
used. Please be sure to prepare a small such document even for submissions
which are tar files for the rapid prototype or the final system 
code.</i></blockquote>
